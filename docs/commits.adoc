== Commits

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

=== Examples

- Basic `docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG`
- Basic with scope `feat(lang): add polish language`

More information can be found https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples


=== Notes

Husky should check your commit messages, if these error the commit will not be made.
