## :memo: Style Guides for Git Commit Messages

### Here's a list of some good to have points, that can add more value to your contribution logs.

- fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
- BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type. 
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refractor:, perf:, test:, and others.
- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
 
For more detailed reference to the above points, refer <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">here</a>
